Client
  To build the frontend code in the client folder you need nodejs version 9.7.1
  With nodejs installed go to the client folder and type:

  For setup
    npm i -g npm (to update npm)
    npm install
  
  To run in development mode
    npm run dev

  To build project to the dist folder
    npm run build


Server
  The server uses python 3.6.4 and flask so you have to get that installed before you run the project
  I like to set it up in a virtual environment so this is what i do.
  Go the the server folder and type:
  
  For setup
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv venv
    ./venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  To run project
  Debug
    ./venv/Scripts/python ./server.py
  Productiom
    ./venv/Scripts/python ./server.py production
  Create new database file
    ./venv/Scripts/python ./server.py setup
	

    
Database
  Database changed to sqlite
  To setup run:
  server.py setup
  

  
Both projects work pretty well with Webstorm and Pycharm respectively, you just have to point pycharm to the right virtual environment.
